Resources For Version Control And Git
================================

## Vocabulary
* VCS = Version Control System
* Git = a VCS (there are others)


## Resources for VCS
* [What is VCS?](http://youtu.be/8oRjP8yj2Wo)
  * Very high-level
  * 6-minute screencast; get your headphones on
* [A Visual Guide to Version Control](http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/)
  * High-level visual descriptions of VCS concepts
  * Introduces some vocabulary
  * But visuals are nice
* [Centralized Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-centralized)
 * Somewhat detailed description of our workflow model
 * Don't confuse a *centralized workflow* (how we're implementing VCS using Git) with a *centralized VCS* (e.g., Subversion, which is not our VCS)

  
## Resources for Git
* [A Visual Git Reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)
  * Gets into the weeds a bit
  * Visually describes each VCS concept as implemented in Git


## Miscellaneous
* [Managing a statistical analysis project guidelines and best practices](http://www.r-statistics.com/2010/09/managing-a-statistical-analysis-project-guidelines-and-best-practices/)
  * Not really about VCS or Git, but too good not to share
